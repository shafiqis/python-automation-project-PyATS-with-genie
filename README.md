What is pyATS?
pyATS stands for Python Automated Test System, developed by Cisco.

It is a framework designed for test automation and network automation.

pyATS helps automate testing, validation, and operations tasks in network environments, ensuring consistent and reliable results.
Key Features of pyATS:

Test Automation:
Automates network testing for configurations, connectivity, and performance.

Network Validation:
Verifies the state of devices and networks before and after changes.

Multi-Vendor Support:
Supports various network vendors through modular test cases.

Extensibility:
Provides APIs and plugins for custom tasks.

Ease of Integration:
Works with other tools like Ansible, Nornir, and REST APIs.

Yes, pyATS is a framework because:

It provides a structured foundation to organize, execute, and manage test cases.
It requires you to write scripts or use prebuilt libraries within its framework for specific tasks.
If pyATS Is a Framework, What Is the Tool?
The tool commonly associated with pyATS is Genie.

What Is Genie?
Genie is a library/tool built on top of pyATS.

It provides pre-built test cases, parsers, and utilities for network testing and validation.
While pyATS is the core framework, Genie acts as an accelerator to perform specific network-related tasks, such as retrieving configurations, parsing CLI outputs, and validating network states.
Difference Between pyATS and Genie
Aspect	pyATS (Framework)	Genie (Tool)

Type	Framework for test automation.	Tool/library for network-specific operations.
Purpose	Organizes and executes tests.	Executes predefined tasks and tests.
Scope	Broad: Testing, validation, automation.	Narrow: Parsing, validating network data.
Dependency	Can work without Genie.	Built on top of pyATS.
